## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
* **.NET 8**
* **Microsoft.Extensions.AI.Abstractions** (MCP server tools)
* **OpenWeatherMap API**
* **C#** with async/await
* **Dependency Injection** for logging

## üß™ Testing with VS Code

**Prerequisites:**
- .NET SDK
- VS Code with GitHub Copilot extension
- OpenWeather API key environment variable set up

Steps to test this MCP server from source code (locally):

1. **Set an environment variable for OpenWeatherMap API key**

```bash
# Linux/macOS
export OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"

# Windows (PowerShell)
setx OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY "your_api_key_here"
```

or use mine

```powershell
setx OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY "4d2d3abd8e2b7877d5fa8f2f8a71271a"
```
Note: This API key is provided for quick testing only and may be rotated. For production use, get your own free key at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api).

2. **Clone the repo and open the project folder in VSCode**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sheruyen/WeatherMcpServer.git
code WeatherMcpServer
```

3. **Install and configure the MCP Server in VS Code**

- Follow the steps shown in the demo video above

4. **Open copilot chat in Agent Mode**

Refer to the video demo if stuck.

Once configured, you can ask Copilot Chat (Agent Mode) any of the implemented functions:
- Current weather
- Weather forecast  
- Weather alerts

It should prompt you to use the `get_current_weather` tool on the `WeatherMcpServer` and show you the results.


## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage Examples

* **Get current weather**

```
Current weather in Morocco
```

* **Get 3-day forecast**

```
Weather forecast for New York, US
```

* **Get weather alerts**

```
Are there any weather alerts currently in Tokyo?
```
